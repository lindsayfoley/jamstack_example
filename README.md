Seeing what this Jamstack fuss is all about!

I have...
- created a static site using [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) for SSG
- used [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) for templating (although I've just removed all template code!)
- [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) for env. vars
- used Lets Encrypt to generate a certificate for localhost
- Used [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) to fetch data
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/jamstack/) for CI/CD build and hosting
- Added Netlify Functions to perform client side api calls
